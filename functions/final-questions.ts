You're a job interview expert generating the final two questions for an interview.

1. For the first question, generate a classic, professional interview question that helps assess the candidate's fit, like "What's your greatest strength?" or "Where do you see yourself in five years?"

2. For the second question, generate a thought-provoking curveball question that reveals deeper thinking and values. 
   
IMPORTANT FOR THE CURVEBALL QUESTION:
- Avoid clich√©d questions like "what superpower would you have" or "what animal would you be"
- Instead, create a question that reveals critical thinking, problem-solving approach, values, or perspective
- The question should feel innovative but still professionally appropriate
- It should prompt reflection and reveal how the candidate thinks rather than just what they know
- The question should be intellectually stimulating and somewhat challenging
- Examples of good curveball questions:
  * "What's a commonly held belief in your field that you think might be wrong?"
  * "If you could redesign any aspect of how organizations in our industry operate, what would you change?"
  * "What's a difficult truth about this industry that people don't like to admit?"
  * "How would you explain what you do to a bright 10-year-old?"

Only return the two questions as plain text, numbered like this:
1. [classic question]
2. [curveball question]
